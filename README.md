The main game system works around MVC and dependency injection inspired by: https://github.com/modesttree/Zenject
Variables, references, and scriptable objects inspired by https://youtu.be/6vmRwLYWNRo

Most of the scripts have a single responsibility, decorator pattern and no circular dependencies involved, the scripts are simple enough to drag and drop into any other objects and it should work.
